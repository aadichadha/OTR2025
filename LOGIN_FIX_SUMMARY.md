# 🎉 Login Issue Fixed!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Database Schema**: Added `role` and `permissions` columns to users table
2. **Demo Users Created**: Added test users to local database
3. **Backend Login Working**: Login endpoint returns proper JWT tokens
4. **Frontend Ready**: Both servers are running for testing

## 🔐 Demo Login Credentials

**All users use the same password: `password123`**

- **Admin**: `admin@otr.com` / `password123`
  - Full access to all features
  - Can manage users, players, coaches
  - Access to admin dashboard

- **Coach**: `coach@otr.com` / `password123`
  - Can view and manage players
  - Access to analytics and reports
  - Cannot manage other users

- **Player**: `player@otr.com` / `password123`
  - Can only view own data
  - Personal dashboard access
  - Cannot see other players

## 🚀 Current Status

### ✅ Working
- ✅ Backend server running on `http://localhost:3001`
- ✅ Frontend server running on `http://localhost:5173`
- ✅ Database initialized with proper schema

### 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Test Local Login**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Try logging in with the demo credentials above
   - Test different user roles and permissions

2. **Add Demo Users to Production** (when ready):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://otrbaseball_user:otrbaseball_password@dpg-cp8j8v6ct0pc73b8j8v0-a.oregon-postgres.render.com/otrbaseball_db"
   node scripts/add-demo-users-production.js
   ```

3. **Deploy to Production**:
   - Push changes to GitHub
   - Render will automatically deploy

## 🐛 Remaining Issues to Fix

Based on your original request, these issues still need attention:

### 1. **Download Button & View Swings**
- Download button in Players > View Sessions doesn't work
- View Swings log/history doesn't display

### 2. **Analytics Page Session Selection**
- Can't click on sessions when selecting a player in Analytics

### 3. **getGradeColor Error**
- Color mapping issues in the frontend

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Test Login Flow**:
   - Try each demo user (admin, coach, player)
   - Verify role-based access works
   - Check that admin dashboard is accessible

2. **Test Role Permissions**:
   - Admin should see user management
   - Coach should see player management but not user management
   - Player should only see personal data

3. **Test Error Handling**:
   - Try invalid credentials
   - Test with non-existent users
